# How to Install Rails on Mac

Installing Rails can be a headache. Here's a step by step guide on how I managed to do it successfully on my laptop. I use a Macbook Pro running Mac OS Sierra 10.12.3.

## Getting Started

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

1. Install Homebrew

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2. Install Ruby (version 2.4.0 as of Feburary 8, 2017)

```
brew install rbenv ruby-build

# Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# Install Ruby
rbenv install 2.4.0
rbenv global 2.4.0
ruby -v
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
